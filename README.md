#Bio of Mary Denise Robertson
I was born in South Africa, and came to Chicago 9 years ago to study a PhD in Anthropology. I like Chicago except the winters are *very* cold.

## Time at UChicago
I like UChicago. My three favorite things are 

* Naps in Harper Library

* Free milkshakes on Wednesdays (Do they still do this?)

* Summers

#Reflection
Figuring out how to open the git file through Rstudio was tricky. I'm going to record my workflow once I figure out this committing to Github part. R Markdown was very straightforward - the linked mastering markdown tutorial on Github was really useful.
