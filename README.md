## Background
#### I am from Los Angeles, California and have spent four years living in Western Massachusetts. I have a sister and a cat.

I completed my undergraduate education in **Neuroscience** and **Exercise and Sports Studies** at [Smith College](http://www.smith.edu), where I also competed on the varsity swim team. 

## Interests
