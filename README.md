# Hi, my name is Rachel Kim

I'm a fourth year sociology major in the college. I'm also a history minor. Broadly, I study: 

* race
* tech
* cities
* and the American South.

### Where I'm From
I'm originally from Alpharetta, Georgia, which is a suburb about thirty minutes northeast of Atlanta. 

There's nothing notable about the area, except for the fact that some Real Housewives of Atlanta used to live around there.

### What I Do
I am the education editor of the *South Side Weekly*, where I read, report, and edit pieces about Chicago Public Schools and South Side students, teachers, and families. It's the **best damn paper in the city of Chicago**, if I do say so myself.

Shameless plug: our [2018 Best of the South Side issue](https://southsideweekly.com/best-of-the-south-side-2018/).

I'm also a barista at ExLibris, which is in the Reg.

### Coding Experience
None!
But if it counts, I did some rudimentary html design on [Neopets](http://www.neopets.com//)â€”the website where I spent all of my hours as a kid. Mostly I just used the "marquee" command as often as possible. I also just learned that it works in R. 

<marquee> **This is incredibly exciting.** </marquee>

I've also learned SPSS and GeoDa, but those aren't actually "coding" softwares.

### Goodbye.
