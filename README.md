# About me
Hi! My name is Jenny Xiao. I'm an undergraduate exchange student from the University of Hong Kong. I'm currently in my third year studying political science, American studies, and European studies.

# Nerdy interests
I love anything that has to do with international relations, especially US-China relations, EU-China relations, Chinese foreign policy, IR theory, foreign policy decision-making, political psychology, politcal economy, military strategy, etc. 
# Non-nerdy interests
- Traveling! I traveled to 11 countries last year :) I'm super interested in foreign cultures and I'm friends with people from over 50 countries.
- Recently got into *Game of Thrones* and tries to analyze every episode applying IR theory (realism!!).
