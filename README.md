### Education
I am a second year PhD student at the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations.    
I am interested in **crafts**, **craftsmen** and **craftsmanship**. For my doctoral research, I plan to examine how artisanal work has engaged in the production of cultural representations of China in a global context; how changes in economic and political systems, alongside the effects of imperialism and colonialism, has impacted local craftsmen; and how local encounters with globalization and industrialization influences such basic craft processes as wood carving, pot throwing, textile dying and weaving.  
I want to take this course to *visualize* my research in the future.
