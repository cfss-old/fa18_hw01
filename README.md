### My name is Bobicheng Zhang. I go by **Beau**. It's easier.

<font size="4">I am a MAPSS student with a concentration of psychology. Specifically, I am interested in visual perception and affective neuroscience. I completed my undergraduate degree with a minor of mathematics at the University of Denver where I was involved in a number of psychology research. Here is a taste of what I am interested in:</font>  
<font size="3">

- Perceptual biases in emotion categorization when facing crowds
    - How do people perceive emotions when they see multiple faces?
    
- The effect of chromatic context on emotion perception
    - Does <span style="color:red">colored</span> <span style="color:green">background</span> induce a bias in people's judgement during an emotion categorization task?
    - How can we use this biase, if it exists, to facilitate our emotion regulation process?
    
- Visual ambiguity in binocular rivalry
    - What will we see if our two eyes receive different images?
    - If one eye dominates over the other during rivalry, how do we break that dominance?

<font size="4">Fascinating, aren't they? Anyway, I have only been learning to code using Matlab for a few months before this class. I hope that after ten weeks, I will be able to use R well enough to run a number of statistical analyses in psychology.</font>
