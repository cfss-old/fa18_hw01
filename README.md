## Liam Coles's first homework (The double hashtag gives me section title)

My name is Liam Coles. I am a BA/MA student. I am majoring in Econ but doing my MA in psychology. I am from New York and really like philosophy. I am excited to learn R because it is helpful for my research.

One of my favorite quotes is from Aristotle's Metaphysics, Book Lamda:

>But evidently knowledge and perception and opinion and understanding have always something else as their object, and themselves only by the way. 
>Further, if thinking and being thought of are different, in respect of which does goodness belong to thought? 
>For to he an act of thinking and to he an object of thought are not the same thing.
>We answer that in some cases the knowledge is the object. In the productive sciences it is the substance or essence of the object, matter omitted, and in the theoretical sciences the definition or the act of thinking is the object. 
>Since, then, thought and the object of thought are not different in the case of things that have not matter, the divine thought and its object will be the same, i.e. the thinking will be one with the object of its thought.

This is a block quote caused by indenting with a "greater than" sign

## Reflection of R markdown

So far I like the program. It seems easy to use and has a host of helpful functions that can make my programs run easier.
