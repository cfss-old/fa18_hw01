## Hello World, it's me Robert!
####Er, rather, hello CFSS TA and/or instructor and/or student, it's me Robert! 

My name is Robert Gruener, I am a 4th year PhD student in the *Biological Sciences*. That's right, biology, it's not exactly a social science. 

I am originally from [Oak Creek, Wisconsin](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oak+Creek,+WI+53154/@42.936349,-88.006025,10.46z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x880515a99a48df69:0xad498a349c55da6a!8m2!3d42.8858503!4d-87.8631362). As you can see if you click the link, it is a suburb of Milwaukee (Go Brewers!) and only about 91 miles away. How convenient!

I've actually lived within a 100 mile radius of home my entire life, except for a semester abroad in Italy. ([Link to my blog from Italy](https://rgruener2015.wordpress.com/), hey it was **required** to keep a travel blog throughout the program). I went to undergrad at the University of Wisconsin Madison (go badgers), got my B.S. in biochemistry, honestly didn't have that great of a time, but still decided to go for more school right afterwards anyway. So here I am at Uchicago (go maroons). 

Currently, I am co-mentored in two labs. One is a "wet" lab where I work with cells and mice, and one is computational. I don't have a computational background, so I spend most of my time in the wet lab, but my advisors and I would like me to become more computational for various reasons. Hence this class. If you want to read more about my work, you can check out the [computational lab's website](http://huang-lab.umn.edu/meet-lab-members-0) and look for my bio (you can also see an *okay* pic of me). 

I think that about wraps things up, but I'll go ahead and make a list of things I like doing in my free time just to make sure I get full credit for using different Markdown syntax:
*Going to see musicals
*Reading the occasional books (currently reading [severence](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/19/639251266/in-severance-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-memo))
*Listening to podcasts (Freakonimcs, Dear Hank and John, and Reply All are some of my favs)
*Going for runs (I can run half-marathons, but don't like signing up for races)
*Just started bouldering at First Ascent (aka rock climbing)
*Wasting time on YouTube
*Checking out things in Chicago (so sad the summer Millenium Park concerts are over)

Thanks for reading my bio!
