# Dissertation
My dissertation's current working title is *A tale of stolen things: rethinking S찾o Paulo's modernity through theft, 1880-1930*. I'm currently working with over five hundred criminal cases collected from S찾o Paulo's judiciary archive as well as hundreds of logbooks from local jails, police stations, and the city's justice deparment. I'll also work with newspapers, literary books, fashion manuals, and many other printed sources. I'm hoping that pursuing the certificate will help me better understand and use all my data.
