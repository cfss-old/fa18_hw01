## Introduction

Hello. My name is Mariel. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Economics Department. My research is on labor economics. I have a 3-month old daughter, Isabel. I love to show people pictures of her.

## How I Made Changes to This File

To make changes to this file, I did the following things:

(@) I forked the repo from the class GitHub page to my GitHub page. What is the difference between fork and pull? According to [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), 

> "A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea."  

Before leaving the page, I copied the URL by selecting "Clone or Download."

(@) In RStudio, I started a new project: File > New Project > Version Control > Git, and pasting the URL that I copied in step (1). I selected a directory and then clicked "Create Project."

(@) For this project, I needed to install R Markdown. I did this by typing `install.packages("rmarkdown")` in the Console.

(@) Next, I found a [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) and started playing around. 

(@) The following step is to save, and commit the changes. To commit the changes, I click the “Git” tab in the upper right pane; check the “Staged” box for the README.md; click “Commit”; type a message in “Commit message” describing what modifications I’ve made to the staged files; and finally, click “Commit”.

(@) Finally, I *pull* from GitHub, and then I *push* to GitHub. Both of these can be done in the GitHub window in RStudio. 

That's all!
