### Wait who are you and why haven't i seen you in class

Great question! I have several chronic health conditions which I am still learning to functionally cope with. I also have frequent medical appointments, which are often very urgent and very difficult to reschedule. I usually love to overshare, but i feel like a list of my diagnoses would be considered a little inappropriate here (?).

### Life story, up to now

Raised in a wealthy WASP household with two parents and two older siblings just outside of Washington, DC. I knew that UChicago was my top choice for undergrad because of its

* reputation for theoretical rigor
* strong social science division
* unofficial slogan "where fun goes to die"

Attending UChicago would turn out to be one of the **worst**, or at least most harrowing, decisions of my life. I'm honestly thankful that me and my friends all made it through alive (not everyone can say the same). I got one BA in Mathematics and another BA with honors in Sociology.

_Fun fact_: i am obsessed with wacky mixed methods! Check out this directed graph illustrating the system of conditional entailments constructed from a qualitative-comparative coincidence analysis i used in my sociology BA thesis!

##### (life story cont.)

I wanted a research-related MA so I could have a fancy stamp on my resume making it slightly easier to get industry research jobs. I decided to settle for UChicago, despite my experiences in undergrad, because

1. i already live in hp
2. i already know how the faculty and administration like to operate
3. i got a 75% scholarship

And im taking this class because I think some of the most promising mixed-methods in social science today are computational (and it looks good on a resume)!

### Personality
