#### Report My Process

From now on, I will report my process about how I got changes into _README.md_ on Github via pull request. To edit _README.md_ file, I followed the instruction at [the homework guideline page](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/hw01-edit-README.html#fn1). It helped me a lot to figure out the work that I need to do. The hardest thing was to understand the overall workflow and the concept of markdown. Also, uploading my photo with markdown was not easy; I solved the issue by uploading my photo to my github repository and inserting the link to my autobiography. To me, (as it is supossed to be) the markdown seems similar to html language. Therefore, it helped me to get sense of it; however, the writing down markdown at RStudio seems a bit different from writing down R script at the same program. When I click the _Run_ button, the console reports many errors. I could see the result as I want by using the *preview* button and the result popped up as html page via *R Markdown* panel. The tutorials at the course site and the referred [DARING FIREBALL](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) was very helpful for doing this homework.
