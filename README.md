#Introduction
My name is **Lauren Guillot**. I am a student in the *Masters of Arts in the Social Sciences program*. I study political science, specifically [American politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_politics_(political_science) with a focus on public opinion, political behavior, and political psychology.
I am taking Computing for the Social Sciences to learn to:
* create models
* design visuals for my data
* because programming is fun
