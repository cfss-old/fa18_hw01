__*Hello*__

My name is Elaine Chen. I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Political Science and Economics.

##Where I'm from

I moved around growing up. I was born in Taiwan, and then at three years old, I moved to the Bay Area. I stayed in the Bay Area until the end of middle school, and then I moved back to Asia to Beijing. I stayed in Beijing until high school graduation, and then I came to Chicago for college.

##What I like to do

Here's a list of some the things I'm involved with on campus:

1. Journalism --- the Chicago Maroon and South Side Weekly
2. Dance --- click [here](https://www.facebook.com/UChicagoMaya/) for a link to my dance group's Facebook page!
