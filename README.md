## It's Nice to Meet You


Hello world, my name is Ava Jurden and I'm from __Kansas City, Missouri__.  I have 2 brothers, Zac is a year older than me and Eli is a year younger than me. My parents, Frank and Denise, have been married for 30 years and still live in the house that I grew up in.


##School


I completed my undergraduate studies at __University of Denver__ where I studied Psychology and Biology in 2016.  While I was there I worked for Dr. Sara Watamura in the Child Health and Development Laboratory.  I'm excited for this year's MAPSS program in which I'm concentrating in Psychology.  I'll be working with Dr. Hallberg in UChicago's Urban Labs studying the effects of homelessness on adolescents' academic and social outcomes.


##Employment


Over the past two years, I was working as a *Teach for America Corps Member* in my hometown. I taught preschool at __Operation Breakthrough__, a school serving low income families on Kansas City's east side.
